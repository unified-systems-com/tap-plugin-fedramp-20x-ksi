# FedRAMP 20x KSI Catalog Collector Specification

## Philosophy

This spec defines the runtime collector that pulls the FedRAMP 20x KSI catalog from its canonical upstream at [github.com/FedRAMP/rules](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rules), validates it against pinned safety rules, diffs against the local TAP grid, and submits the resulting changes through the `tap_cares` GRIFT import surface.

It supersedes the **authorship-tooling approach** previously documented in `spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-v0.md` (`req-fedramp-20x-ksi-refresh` + related): a CI-generated wave shipped inside the plugin repo via a nightly GitHub Action and a 974-line `skills/refresh-ksi-catalog/refresh.py` tool. That path is being fully deprecated and removed. The plugin has no current users, so there is no migration concern and no transitional dual path.

The new architecture inverts the locus of catalog collection from **plugin authoring time** to **installation runtime**. A local TAP installation collects, validates, diffs, and merges catalog content directly into its own grid, with every run observable as an on-grid `CollectionJob`. The plugin's role narrows to: ship the models, edges, dimensions, and a single current-time seed file needed for a cold-start install; everything after first install is collector-driven.

v0 deliberately uses HTTPS-only fetch from the upstream raw content URL — not a git clone. This is a short-term simplification, not a long-term posture; it costs us cryptographic provenance (commit signatures, ancestor-of-last-known-SHA verification, author/email visibility) in exchange for fast delivery. A future `GitCollectorBase` abstraction (see [Future Work](#future-work)) will get the provenance chain back and is expected to land soon. Until then the v0 collector compensates with paranoid content-level safety checks — every flag is block-class, no warn tier. The full trust-model caveat is in [Runtime Safety Model](#runtime-safety-model).

Long-term — likely after `tap_cares` emitters land — a complementary emitter will close the loop by pushing local-instance updates back to the FedRAMP/rules repo, making a local TAP installation the canonical authoring path for the public catalog. That is explicitly out of scope for v0.

## Vocabulary

This spec inherits the catalog vocabulary (Theme, Indicator, Certification Class, Controls, KSI) from `spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-v0.md` § Vocabulary. Collector-specific terms:

- **Collector** — the on-grid `Collector` node registered by `tap_cares.registry`; the entity that the scheduler / manual invocation targets.
- **Collection Run** — one invocation of the collector, materialized as a `CollectionJob` on the grid.
- **Pinned schema** — the byte-exact copy of the FedRAMP consolidated-rules JSON Schema that the collector validates fetched upstream content against. Lives in the plugin source tree; updating it requires a reviewed PR.
- **Block flag** — a safety violation; in v0 every safety flag is block-class. Halts the run before any grid mutation.

## Goals

|    |               |                                                                 |
| :---: | ---        | ---                                                             |
| 1. | Runtime         | Catalog collection happens at the local TAP installation, not in plugin CI |
| 2. | Observable      | Every run produces an on-grid `CollectionJob` with status, timestamps, error context, and links to imported GRIFT batches |
| 3. | Safe            | Block-level safety violations abort the run before any grid mutation |
| 4. | Diff-Driven     | The submitted batch contains only the delta between fetched upstream and live grid state |
| 5. | Deterministic   | Entity IDs are stable derivations of catalog codes, so re-runs upsert in place |
| 6. | tap_cares-Native | Built strictly on the `CollectorBase` / `CollectorBase.submit_grift` contracts; no special-cased plumbing |

### Collector Class
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-class`
Status: `Proposed`

The runtime collector is a `CollectorBase` subclass, `KSICollector`, that lives in the plugin code and is registered into `collector_registry` at app startup.

#### Implementation

- Module: `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/ksi_catalog.py`.
- Class: `class KSICollector(CollectorBase)`.
- `run()` orchestrates the pipeline: fetch → schema-validate → diff vs grid → safety-check → assemble GRIFT → `self.submit_grift(...)`. Results accumulate via `self.record_info(...)` / `self.record_error(...)`; the task body persists them at terminal state. See `tap_cares/specs/spec-tap-cares-collector.md` `req-tap-cares-collector-job-sole-writer` for the accumulator pattern.
- KSI-specific configuration lives as class attributes (URL, schema path, UUID namespace, deletion threshold). v0 does not introduce per-instance configuration — the framework `CollectorConfig` shape (just the two entity IDs) is sufficient.
- Registration happens in `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/apps.py` inside `Fedramp20xKsiConfig.ready()`:

```python
def ready(self) -> None:
    from tap_cares.registry import register_collector
    from tap_plugin.fedramp_20x_ksi.collectors.ksi_catalog import KSICollector

    register_collector(
        key="ksi-catalog",
        cls=KSICollector,
        name="FedRAMP 20x KSI Catalog",
        description="Fetches the FedRAMP 20x KSI catalog from the upstream rules repo, validates against pinned safety rules, diffs against the local grid, and imports changes as a GRIFT batch.",
    )
```

- The registered key is `ksi-catalog`; with `__module__`-based scope inference, the full registry key persisted on the on-grid `Collector` node is `tap_plugin.fedramp_20x_ksi.collectors.ksi_catalog:ksi-catalog`.
- The on-grid `Collector` node is created by `reconcile_collector_nodes()` (run by the boot orchestrator under a bound actor after `ready()`), **not** by `register_collector` itself and **not** seeded via GRIFT. `register_collector` at `ready()` only records the runner and its descriptor. Since `Collector` is `INTERNAL_ONLY` (see `req-tap-cares-collector-model-9`), GRIFT import would reject the seed. Identity is deterministic: `entity_id = uuid5(NAMESPACE_COLLECTOR, "tap_plugin.fedramp_20x_ksi.collectors.ksi_catalog:ksi-catalog")`. The first reconcile creates the row; subsequent reconciles converge it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-class-1 | CollectorBase Subclass | Proposed | `KSICollector` inherits from `tap_cares.collectors.CollectorBase` and implements `run()`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-class-2 | AppConfig Registration | Proposed | `Fedramp20xKsiConfig.ready()` registers the runner class read-only via `register_collector(key="ksi-catalog", cls=KSICollector, name=..., description=...)`; the on-grid Collector node is materialized by `reconcile_collector_nodes()` after `ready()`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-class-3 | Reconcile Creates On-Grid Node | Proposed | The on-grid `Collector` node is created by `reconcile_collector_nodes()` after `ready()`, not by `register_collector` and not by GRIFT seed. `Collector.INTERNAL_ONLY = True` closes the GRIFT path. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-class-4 | No Per-Instance Config in v0 | Proposed | KSI-specific configuration is class-level constants; the v0 `CollectorConfig` contract is unchanged. | |

---

### Upstream Fetch
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch`
Status: `Proposed`

The collector fetches the consolidated rules document directly over HTTPS from the FedRAMP/rules repo. No git, no submodule, no auth.

#### Implementation

- Pinned URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FedRAMP/rules/main/fedramp-consolidated-rules.json`.
- Library: `urllib.request` from stdlib (no new dependency). Future revision may move to `httpx` if retry/backoff sophistication is needed.
- Hard cap on response body size: 10 MiB. Anything larger aborts the run as a block flag (`UPSTREAM_OVERSIZED`).
- Strict `Content-Type` check: must be `application/json` or `text/plain`; anything else aborts as a block flag (`UPSTREAM_BAD_CONTENT_TYPE`).
- Connection + read timeout: 30 s each. Network or HTTP failures fail the run via the standard exception path; the `CollectionJob.summary` carries the underlying error type and message.
- The fetched body is treated strictly as data. No code path interprets fetched strings as URLs to follow, paths to read, or instructions of any kind. (Carries forward `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-refresh-11`.)

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch-1 | HTTPS GET Only | Proposed | The collector fetches via HTTPS GET; no git, no clone, no shell. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch-2 | Pinned URL | Proposed | The fetch URL is a class constant. Changes require code review. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch-3 | Body Size Cap | Proposed | Bodies > 10 MiB abort the run with block flag `UPSTREAM_OVERSIZED`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch-4 | Content-Type Check | Proposed | Non-JSON `Content-Type` aborts the run with block flag `UPSTREAM_BAD_CONTENT_TYPE`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch-5 | Failure Surface | Proposed | Network errors fail the `CollectionJob` and surface in `summary`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch-6 | Content As Data | Proposed | Fetched content is never used as URL, path, or instruction. | |

---

### Collector Self-Test
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-self-test`
Status: `Proposed`

The KSI collector implements the tap-cares self-test/readiness contract (`req-tap-cares-collector-self-test`) with a deliberately narrow scope: can this installed collector reach its configured upstream endpoint?

The self-test is not a lightweight version of the collection pipeline. It must not validate the full upstream catalog, compute a diff, run safety checks, or submit GRIFT. Those are collection-run responsibilities. The self-test answers only whether the collector's own runtime path appears reachable enough that pressing Run is sensible.

v0 checks:

| Code | Status when healthy | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UPSTREAM_URL_CONFIGURED` | `pass` | Pinned URL is present and parseable as HTTPS. |
| `UPSTREAM_REACHABLE` | `pass` | Read-only request to the pinned upstream URL succeeds within the self-test timeout. |

The reachability check may use `HEAD` if the upstream supports it reliably; otherwise it may use a bounded `GET` that reads only enough bytes to prove the endpoint responds. It should reuse the same pinned URL constant as the collection run so the self-test and collector cannot drift.

Expected readiness outcomes:

- `ready` when the URL is configured and reachable.
- `error` when the URL is malformed, not HTTPS, times out, returns a non-success response, or cannot be reached.

The KSI collector has no v0 operator configuration, so it should not normally return `unconfigured` or `misconfigured`. If future KSI target configuration is introduced, this requirement should be revisited.

The failure check should include a `CollectorDocRef` to the KSI collector docs or setup/operations section (this collector is an *emitter* only, `req-tap-cares-collector-self-test-5`; resolution is `specs/spec-docs.md` `req-docs-ref-resolution`, rendering is `tap_web` `req-web-rendering-docref`, both Backlog). The message should be short; canonical explanation belongs in docs.

**Execution model is framework-owned (by reference, not re-specified).** KSI implements only the pure `self_test()` hook. Everything around it is the tap-cares contract and KSI does not restate it: self-test runs as **phase 1 of a `CollectionJob`** (`req-tap-cares-collector-self-test-10`), the run-task body is the sole writer of the structured result onto `CollectionJob.self_test` (`req-tap-cares-collector-self-test-2`), and a non-runnable result fails the job through the **standard collector failure mode** (`req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode`) — `CollectionJob` ends `FAILED` with the self-test summary; there is no `blocked` status. The reachability timeout is bounded by the framework budget (`req-tap-cares-collector-self-test-12`), not a KSI-specific number. The Administrivia Self-test button is a `self_test_only` `CollectionJob` per `req-tap-cares-collector-self-test-16`; KSI neither knows nor cares which run mode invoked it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-self-test-1 | Implements tap-cares Contract | Proposed | `KSICollector` implements the tap-cares collector self-test/readiness hook. | Cross-ref `req-tap-cares-collector-self-test`. |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-self-test-2 | Reachability Only | Proposed | The KSI self-test checks only upstream URL configuration/reachability, not full catalog validity, diff, safety, or GRIFT import behavior. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-self-test-3 | No Mutation | Proposed | The KSI self-test performs no grid mutation and no GRIFT import. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-self-test-4 | Ready On Reachable | Proposed | Self-test status is `ready` when the pinned HTTPS upstream is reachable. | |

| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-self-test-8 | Bounded By Framework | Proposed | The reachability check is timeout-bounded per the framework budget, not a KSI-chosen number. | Cross-ref `req-tap-cares-collector-self-test-12`. |

---

### Pinned Schema and UUID Namespace
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin`
Status: `Proposed`

Two pinned files survive from the old refresh tooling, but they relocate from the tool's `pinned/` directory into the plugin's normal source tree:

- `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/pinned/source_schema.json` — KSI-scoped JSON Schema for the upstream consolidated-rules document. The collector validates fetched content against this; drift in the KSI subtree is a block flag. The schema treats `$.info`, `$.FRR`, and `$.FRD` as opaque sibling sections (validated only as present + object-typed) per `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope`.
- `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/pinned/uuid_namespace.txt` — UUIDv5 namespace string. Theme entity_ids derive from `uuid5(namespace, f"ksi_theme:{code}")`; indicator entity_ids derive from `uuid5(namespace, f"ksi_indicator:{code}")`. This must never change.

Updating either file is a deliberate, reviewed code change. The collector does not auto-update them, ever.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin-1 | Pinned Schema Location | Proposed | Pinned schema lives at `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/pinned/source_schema.json`. | Carried over byte-exact from the old skill's pinned/. |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin-2 | Pinned Namespace Location | Proposed | UUIDv5 namespace lives at `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/pinned/uuid_namespace.txt`. | Same value as today's `0197fed0-4000-7000-8000-000000000100`. |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin-3 | Entity ID Derivation | Proposed | Theme and indicator entity IDs derive from `uuid5(namespace, "<kind>:<code>")`, identical to today's tool. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin-4 | No Auto-Update | Proposed | The collector never writes to either pinned file. | |

---

### Validation Scope
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope`
Status: `Implemented`

The upstream document is now "FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026" — it carries definitions (FRD), requirements (FRR), and key security indicators (KSI). The plugin only ingests the KSI subtree. The pinned schema's strictness matches the scope of ingestion: paranoid where we depend on shape, opaque where we don't.

#### Scope levels

| Path | Validation posture | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top-level | Strict: `required: [info, FRD, FRR, KSI]`, the four required siblings plus the optional `CTL` sibling allowed, `additionalProperties: false` | Detects "upstream removed a section" or "upstream added an *unreviewed* new top-level section" — both trust-anchor signals worth flagging. A genuinely-new section blocks until a human reviews it and updates the pin; that review happened for `CTL` (2026-06, FedRAMP's organization-defined-parameter baseline), so it is now an allowed-but-opaque sibling rather than a block. |
| `$.KSI.*` | Strict: themes, indicators, and all nested shapes validated against the pinned subschema | This is the load-bearing data we ingest. Drift here changes what the grid sees. |
| `$.info`, `$.FRR`, `$.FRD`, `$.CTL` | Opaque: validated only as present (or, for `CTL`, optional) and object-typed (`{"type": "object"}`) | These sibling sections exist in the upstream document but we never read them. Validating their interiors would block on every upstream editorial change without protecting anything we depend on. The upstream FedRAMP team is actively iterating on FRR/FRD shape (front_matter, status, purpose, tag, do_not_link, artifacts, effective_date, revision-splitting `both` → `20x`/`rev5`); `CTL` (14 control families / ~79 controls of FedRAMP ODP values) is orthogonal to KSI ingestion and tolerated as opaque. |

#### Safety walk scope

The non-schema safety checks distinguish between *tamper-resistance* walks (which apply to the whole document) and *content-rendering* walks (which apply only to data we present to humans):

| Check | Scope | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_check_structural_caps` (byte cap, theme cap, indicator cap, array len, string len) | whole doc | A bloated FRR section is just as suspicious as a bloated KSI section for trust-anchor purposes. |
| `_check_character_classes` (BiDi overrides, control chars) | whole doc | Adversarial character signals are concerning anywhere. |
| `_check_denylist` (prompt-injection heuristics) | `$.KSI` only | We render KSI content; prompt-injection denylist matches on FRR rule statements would be noise. |
| `_check_outliers` (anomalously long strings vs siblings) | `$.KSI` only | Long FRR rule statements are upstream's editorial choice, not a tamper signal in data we don't present. |

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope-1 | Top-Level Strict | Implemented | Pinned schema enforces `required: [info, FRD, FRR, KSI]` and `additionalProperties: false` at the document root. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope-2 | KSI Subtree Strict | Implemented | `$.KSI.*` is validated against the full pinned subschema (theme shape, indicator shape, varies-by-class, updated_list, etc.). | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope-3 | Sibling Sections Opaque | Implemented | `$.info`, `$.FRR`, `$.FRD`, and the optional `$.CTL` are validated only as present (CTL: when present) and object-typed. Their interiors may change shape upstream without affecting KSI ingestion. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope-4 | Outlier Walk Scoped | Implemented | `_check_outliers` walks only the `$.KSI` subtree because outlier-length signals are meaningful for content we render, not for sibling data. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-validation-scope-5 | Tamper-Resistance Walks Stay Global | Implemented | `_check_structural_caps` and `_check_character_classes` continue to walk the whole document — they are about adversarial-content detection, not ingestion semantics. | |

---

### Runtime Safety Model
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety`
Status: `Proposed`

The safety check set is a deliberate subset of the existing `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-safety` model, adapted to runtime context. **Every check is block-class.** The previous warn / block distinction is collapsed: anything the safety model flags fails the run, period. The grid is live; we accept the cost of strictness over the risk of a missed signal slipping through as a "warning."

#### Trust model caveat

HTTPS-only fetch (`req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch`) deliberately does **not** carry git-level provenance. We have:

- TLS to GitHub's raw content host
- A pinned URL (host + path)

We do **not** have:

- A cryptographic chain of trust through commit signatures
- Ancestor-of-last-known-SHA verification against the upstream history
- Per-commit author/email/sign visibility

If an attacker compromises GitHub's serving infrastructure, our DNS, or the upstream branch (e.g., force-pushes a poisoned commit), the content-level safety checks listed below are the only thing standing between bad upstream content and our grid. They have to carry that weight without help. Hence the paranoid posture (every flag is block) and the prominence of the future git-collector-base abstraction in [Future Work](#future-work) — that gets the provenance chain back.

#### Block-class checks

The KSI-specific block-class flag vocabulary. The *mechanics* of how a collector records errors and aborts a run are framework-level (see `tap_cares/specs/spec-tap-cares-collector.md` `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode`); this section specifies the KSI-specific check set, codes, and thresholds.

| Code | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `SCHEMA_DRIFT` | Fetched JSON fails validation against the pinned schema. |
| `UNKNOWN_FIELD` | Fetched content contains a key not declared in the pinned schema's `properties`. |
| `STRUCTURAL_CAP` | Catalog exceeds size caps: total bytes > 10 MiB, > 20 themes, > 100 indicators per theme, > 100 KiB per string field, > 200 items per array. |
| `CHARACTER_CLASS` | Any string field contains a Unicode BiDi override character or a control character other than `\t` / `\n`. |
| `DENYLIST_PHRASE` | A string field matches the safety denylist (prompt-injection heuristics). Promoted from warn → block per the paranoid-posture decision. |
| `OUTLIER_STRING_LENGTH` | A string field is dramatically longer than the field's historical norm. Promoted from warn → block per the paranoid-posture decision. |
| `MASS_DELETION` | Diff would deprecate > 10% of live indicators in one run (see `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-mass-deletion`). |
| `UPSTREAM_OVERSIZED` | Fetch body > 10 MiB (see `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch`). |
| `UPSTREAM_BAD_CONTENT_TYPE` | Non-JSON content-type (see `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-fetch`). |

#### Dropped checks

Provenance / commit-history checks from the old refresh tool that have no runtime analogue under HTTPS fetch:

| Code | Why dropped |
| --- | --- |
| `INTEGRITY_REWIND` | No submodule pointer to compare against; we fetch live state, not a pointer advance. Comes back with the future git collector base class. |
| `ORIGIN_MISMATCH` (git URL) | We're fetching from a pinned HTTPS URL; the host/path *is* the origin check. Comes back with the future git collector base class. |
| `commit_author_drift` | No commit log in a live JSON fetch. Comes back with the future git collector base class. |
| `low_quality_commit_message` | Same. |
| `signed` / `verified` checks | Same. |

The safety denylist content moves from `skills/refresh-ksi-catalog/safety/denylist.json` to `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/safety/denylist.json` byte-for-byte.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety-1 | All Flags Block | Proposed | Every flag in the KSI block-class table is block-class for the KSI collector. There is no warn tier in v0; KSI's policy is that any recorded error aborts the run. | KSI policy decision; framework permits collectors to record-and-continue (see `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode-4`). |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety-2 | Follows Framework Failure Mode | Proposed | KSI signals failure via the framework protocol in `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode`: `self.record_error(...)` accumulates every detectable safety / drift flag for the run, then `run()` raises `KSICollectorError` to terminate. KSI does not set `self.summary` on the failure path; the task body falls back to the count-derived `"Failed with N error(s)"` per `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode-3`. On the success path KSI sets `self.summary` per `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode-7`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety-3 | KSI Code Vocabulary | Proposed | The block-class code table above (`SCHEMA_DRIFT`, `UNKNOWN_FIELD`, `STRUCTURAL_CAP`, `CHARACTER_CLASS`, `DENYLIST_PHRASE`, `OUTLIER_STRING_LENGTH`, `MASS_DELETION`, `UPSTREAM_OVERSIZED`, `UPSTREAM_BAD_CONTENT_TYPE`) is the KSI-specific contract; new codes require updating this spec. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety-4 | Denylist Ported | Proposed | The existing safety denylist content is moved into the plugin's `collectors/safety/` directory byte-for-byte. | |

### Live Diff Against Grid
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-diff`
Status: `Proposed`

Prior state for the diff is the **live local TAP grid**, not a replay of shipped wave files. The collector reads existing `ksi_theme` and `ksi_indicator` entities via an approved read surface (search system or service-layer reads) and compares them to the fetched upstream by `code`.

This drops the wave-replay machinery entirely. Empty grid (fresh install) → every fetched theme/indicator classifies as `new`. Grid already at upstream-current → diff is empty → no GRIFT batch is submitted; the run still succeeds.

#### Implementation

- Read path: a search or read-service call returns the current set of `ksi_theme` + `ksi_indicator` entities, with each entity's `code` field plus enough state to detect modifications (statement text, classes, status, etc.).
- Comparison: by `code` for both themes and indicators, since codes are the stable upsert keys (`req-fedramp-20x-ksi-models`).
- Classification per entity: `new` / `modified` / `unchanged` / `removed`.
- `removed` entities are emitted as a modification setting `status = "deprecated"` (deprecation-via-modification, preserved from `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-reference-4`). They are **not** deleted. Delete semantics are explicitly deferred (see [Future Work](#future-work)).
- `unchanged` entities produce no node entries in the output batch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-diff-1 | Read From Grid | Proposed | Prior state is read from the local TAP grid via an approved read surface, not from wave files. | |

### GRIFT Batch Output
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-grift`
Status: `Proposed`

Each non-empty run produces exactly one GRIFT batch, submitted via `self.submit_grift(...)` (the `CollectorBase` method that wraps `grift_import` and accumulates batch IDs on the collector instance). The batch's `description_json` uses a new runtime format, **`tap.fedramp_20x_ksi.collection-v0`**, which simplifies the old `wave-v0` schema by dropping fields that don't apply at runtime.

#### `collection-v0` shape

`description_json.format == "tap.fedramp_20x_ksi.collection-v0"`

`description_json.data`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "v0",
  "source": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FedRAMP/rules/main/fedramp-consolidated-rules.json",
    "fetched_at": "<RFC3339>",
    "content_sha256": "<hex>",
    "byte_size": <int>,
    "rules_version": "<string>"
  },
  "changes": {
    "themes_new": <int>,
    "themes_modified": <int>,
    "themes_deprecated": <int>,
    "indicators_new": <int>,
    "indicators_modified": <int>,
    "indicators_deprecated": <int>,
    "catalog_size_before": <int>,
    "catalog_size_after": <int>,
    "deletion_ratio": <float>
  }
}
```

The batch's `description_json.data` carries only **what was successfully collected and submitted**: source provenance and change counts. There is no `safety` field — every safety check is block-class (`req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety-1`), so a successful submission means *no* safety flags fired. Failed runs produce no batch at all; the structured failure detail lives in `CollectionJob.results["error"]` instead.

Dropped fields vs the old `wave-v0`:

- `commits[]` — no commit log in HTTPS fetch. Returns when the future git collector base lands (see [Future Work](#future-work)).
- `wave.index` / `wave.filename` / `wave.is_initial` — collection runs aren't a numbered wave sequence.
- `wave.authored_at` / `wave.authored_by` — `CollectionJob.started_at` and the run's caller-context already carry this.
- `safety.review_required` / `safety.flags` — superseded by the per-flag block model plus `CollectionJob.results["error"]`.

The batch entity_id is a fresh UUIDv7 per run. Individual theme/indicator entity_ids are the same deterministic UUIDv5 values as today (`req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin-3`), so GRIFT upsert lands changes on the existing entities rather than creating duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Mass-Deletion Guard
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-mass-deletion`
Status: `Proposed`

Inherits the spirit of `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-refresh-6`: a single run may not deprecate more than 10% of live indicators. Crossing the threshold raises block flag `MASS_DELETION`, fails the job, and prevents grid mutation.

The ratio is computed against the live grid count: `deprecated_count / live_indicator_count`. With an empty grid, the threshold is undefined and is treated as not triggered (a fresh install can land the whole catalog as `new` without firing).

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-mass-deletion-1 | 10% Threshold | Proposed | Deprecation ratio > 10% of live indicators raises block flag `MASS_DELETION`. | |

| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-mass-deletion-3 | Fresh Install Exempt | Proposed | An empty grid (zero live indicators) does not trigger the guard. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-mass-deletion-4 | Threshold Adjustable in Code | Proposed | The threshold is a single class constant on `KSICollector`. | Reviewed change, not runtime-configurable. |

---

### CollectionJob Result Shape
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result`
Status: `Proposed`

The KSI collector uses the existing `CollectionJob` lifecycle states (`READY`/`RUNNING`/`FAILED`/`SUCCESSFUL`) and the structured `results` field defined in `req-tap-cares-collector-job-model` (the `info` / `warn` / `error` buckets with four-field entries). No KSI-specific state, edge type, or metadata field. All structured failure surfacing flows through `self.record_error(...)` on the collector instance; all run-level successes flow through `self.record_info(...)`. Entries accumulate in `self.results` and are persisted by the task body at terminal state (see `req-tap-cares-collector-job-sole-writer`).

Produced-batch correlation uses the canonical contract: a run's GRIFT batches are linked by `CollectionJob --PRODUCED_BATCH--> Batch` edges, each carrying a `disposition` property ∈ {`imported`,`skipped`}, created by the task body at terminal state. There is **no `CollectionJob.grift_batches` field** — see `tap_cares/specs/spec-tap-cares-collector.md` `req-tap-cares-collector-grift-import-6` / `req-tap-cares-collector-job-model-20` and `tap_grid/specs/spec-grid-edge.md` `req-grid-edge-produced-batch`. "Which batch did this run produce" is answered by traversing the `PRODUCED_BATCH` edge, not by reading a field.

#### Successful run (no changes)

- `status = SUCCESSFUL`
- `summary` = `"No changes — already up to date (<N> indicators)."` (collector-set at end of `run()`).
- no `PRODUCED_BATCH` edges (the empty diff submits no GRIFT batch).
- `results["info"]` contains entries for: `RUN_STARTED`, `UPSTREAM_FETCHED`, `DIFF_EMPTY`, `RUN_COMPLETED`.
- `results["error"]` empty.

#### Successful run (changes submitted)

- `status = SUCCESSFUL`
- `summary` carries a collector-authored one-liner describing the import (counts of new / modified / deprecated indicators and themes plus imported batch count). See `_summarize_import` in `ksi_catalog.py`.
- exactly one `CollectionJob --PRODUCED_BATCH--> Batch` edge with `disposition = imported`, pointing at the single `Batch` this run produced.
- `results["info"]` contains entries for: `RUN_STARTED`, `UPSTREAM_FETCHED`, `DIFF_COMPUTED` (with counts in context), `GRIFT_SUBMITTED` (with batch entity_id in context), `RUN_COMPLETED`.
- `results["error"]` empty.

#### Failed run

- `status = FAILED`
- `summary` carries the count-derived one-liner (`"Failed with N error(s)"`) computed by the task body from `len(results["error"])` — KSI does not set `self.summary` on the failure path. See `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode-3`.
- no `PRODUCED_BATCH` edges — KSI aborts before `submit_grift`, so nothing reached the grid.
- `results["error"]` contains one entry per flag raised, each with its own `site` UUIDv7, `code`, `message`, and `context` (the dict of relevant counts, fragments, or paths into the source document — collector's call what's useful for the investigator). Schema-drift runs in particular accumulate one entry per `iter_errors` validation failure so a single run surfaces every drift site rather than only the first.
- `results["info"]` may contain partial-run breadcrumbs (`RUN_STARTED`, `UPSTREAM_FETCHED`) for runs that got past initial steps before failing.

#### Result event vocabulary (v0)

| Level | Code | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `info` | `RUN_STARTED` | First action of `run()`. Context: collector entity_id, job entity_id. |
| `info` | `UPSTREAM_FETCHED` | After successful HTTPS GET + content-type / size checks. Context: URL, byte_size, content_sha256, rules_version. |
| `info` | `DIFF_COMPUTED` | After diff produces a non-empty changeset. Context: counts (new / modified / deprecated for themes and indicators). |
| `info` | `DIFF_EMPTY` | Diff produces no changes; no GRIFT submission to follow. |
| `info` | `GRIFT_SUBMITTED` | After `CollectorBase.submit_grift` returns successfully. Context: batch entity_id, imported count. |
| `info` | `RUN_COMPLETED` | Last action of `run()`. Context: terminal status. |
| `error` | `SCHEMA_DRIFT` | Pinned-schema validation failed. Context: validator error path + message. |
| `error` | `UNKNOWN_FIELD` | Upstream contains a key not in pinned schema. Context: path. |
| `error` | `STRUCTURAL_CAP` | Size cap breached. Context: which cap, observed value, limit. |
| `error` | `CHARACTER_CLASS` | Disallowed character. Context: path, character codepoint. |
| `error` | `DENYLIST_PHRASE` | Denylist match. Context: path, phrase fragment. |
| `error` | `OUTLIER_STRING_LENGTH` | Anomalous length. Context: path, observed length, historical norm. |
| `error` | `MASS_DELETION` | Deprecation ratio > threshold. Context: ratio, deprecated count, live count. |
| `error` | `UPSTREAM_OVERSIZED` | Fetch body > 10 MiB. Context: byte_size. |
| `error` | `UPSTREAM_BAD_CONTENT_TYPE` | Wrong content-type. Context: observed content_type. |
| `error` | `UPSTREAM_FETCH_FAILED` | Network / HTTP error. Context: exception class, message. |

This vocabulary is the v0 KSI collector contract; new collectors emit their own codes under the same shape.

The `warn` bucket is unused by the v0 KSI collector — every safety flag is block-class. The bucket exists at the `tap_cares` level so future collectors with genuinely non-fatal events can populate it without schema churn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-1 | No New Status States | Proposed | The KSI collector uses only the existing `READY`/`RUNNING`/`FAILED`/`SUCCESSFUL` states. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-2 | Successful Empty | Proposed | A run that detects no changes still succeeds; no `PRODUCED_BATCH` edge is created; `results["info"]` records `DIFF_EMPTY`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-3 | Block → FAILED | Proposed | Any block flag fails the job. `record_error` is called for every flag raised; the failure `summary` is the count-derived one-liner produced by the task body (see `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode-3`). | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-4 | Vocabulary Documented | Proposed | The v0 event vocabulary above is the contract; new codes require updating the spec. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-5 | Site UUIDs Unique Per Callsite | Proposed | Each `record_*` call in the KSI collector code has a hardcoded UUIDv7 `site` value; the repo-wide uniqueness test (`req-tap-cares-collector-job-model-15`) covers KSI callsites. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-6 | Warn Bucket Unused | Proposed | The KSI collector emits no `warn`-level entries in v0; all safety flags are block-class. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-7 | Success summary authored | Implemented | The KSI collector sets `self.summary` at the end of every successful run with a compact human-readable description: the empty-diff branch writes `"No changes — already up to date (<N> indicators)."`; the import branch writes a counts summary built by `_summarize_import` (indicators added/modified/deprecated, themes, imported batches). The CARES "Summary" column renders this verbatim. | Follows `req-tap-cares-collector-failure-mode-7`. |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-job-result-7 | Standard Observability | Proposed | The job is queryable through standard `tap_cares` surfaces; no KSI-specific reporting plumbing. | |

### Test Strategy
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-test-strategy`
Status: `Proposed`

Two test surfaces:

1. **Unit tests** (fast, no network). Inject upstream content via dependency injection: the collector class exposes its `fetch_upstream()` method as overridable, and tests subclass `KSICollector` (or monkey-patch the class method) to return canned fixtures. Fixtures live at `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/tests/fixtures/ksi_catalog/`:
   - `current.json` — a known-good copy of the upstream content (committed to the repo, refreshed manually as needed).
   - `mass_deletion.json` — variant that triggers `MASS_DELETION`.
   - `schema_drift.json` — variant that fails pinned-schema validation.
   - `unknown_field.json` — variant with an extra top-level key.
   - `oversized.json` — variant that breaches a structural cap.
   - `denylist_block.json` — variant containing a denylist phrase (block-class in v0).

2. **Live-fetch integration test** (slow, requires network). Gated by a pytest marker (`@pytest.mark.live_fetch`) so it can be opted out of in CI by default. Verifies the real HTTPS fetch round-trips and parses, but does not assert on the resulting diff (since upstream content changes).

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-test-strategy-1 | Fixture-Injected Unit Tests | Proposed | Unit tests cover happy path and every block flag by overriding `fetch_upstream()` with fixtures. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-test-strategy-2 | Pinned Fixture Committed | Proposed | `current.json` ships in the repo so tests are deterministic. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-test-strategy-3 | Live Fetch Test Gated | Proposed | A `@pytest.mark.live_fetch` integration test verifies real network fetch and parsing; skipped by default. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-test-strategy-4 | End-to-End Via tap_cares | Proposed | A unit test invokes `run_collection(collector)` and asserts that the `CollectionJob` transitions through the expected states and produces the expected `PRODUCED_BATCH` edge(s). | |

---

### Deprecation of Authorship Tooling
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation`
Status: `Implemented`

The catalog refresh authorship tooling is fully removed in this phase. Concretely:

#### Code and infrastructure deletions

- `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/skills/refresh-ksi-catalog/` (entire directory, including `refresh.py`, `SKILL.md`, `pinned/`, `safety/`, `state/`, and the `upstream/` submodule).
- The submodule entry for `upstream/` in the plugin's `.gitmodules`.
- `.github/workflows/refresh-catalog.yml` (the nightly action in the plugin's own repo).
- Any `skills` entry referencing `refresh-ksi-catalog` in `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/tap-plugin.toml`.

#### Surviving content moves

- `pinned/source_schema.json` → `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/pinned/source_schema.json` (byte-exact).
- `pinned/uuid_namespace.txt` → `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/pinned/uuid_namespace.txt` (byte-exact).
- `safety/denylist.json` → `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/safety/denylist.json` (byte-exact).
- Useful algorithmic functions from `refresh.py` (parsing, validation against pinned schema, UUID derivation, structural caps, character-class gates, deletion-ratio computation, denylist scan) are ported into `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/ksi_catalog.py` as private module functions. The functions are *re-implemented* against the new shape (no submodule context, no commit metadata) rather than copied wholesale; the goal is a clean module ~200–400 LOC rather than a 974-line port.

#### Existing v0 spec impact

The following requirements in `spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-v0.md` change status as part of this phase:

| RID | New Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-refresh` | `Deprecated` | Authorship-tooling architecture; superseded by this spec. Notes the supersession explicitly. |
| `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-wave-schema` | `Deprecated` | `wave-v0` format is replaced by `collection-v0` (see `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-grift`). Existing waves in the repo will be scrubbed (`req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation-3`) so no historical `wave-v0` payload survives in shipped data. |
| `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-safety` | `Deprecated` | Replaced by `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety`. The retained checks survive; CI-specific ones drop. |
| `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-reference` | `Revised` | Catalog seed ships as a single GRIFT file (see below); the "catalog content distributes as a sequence of dated waves" contract is dropped. The wave cadence dies; the seed survives, singular. |

Models (`ksi_theme`, `ksi_indicator`), edges (`CONTAINS_INDICATOR`), icons, dimensions, status, classes, controls, NIST crosswalk plans — all unaffected.

#### Seed file

The plugin continues to ship a current-time catalog snapshot for fresh-install cold-start. The shape changes from a dated-wave cadence to **a single seed file**:

- Filename: `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/grift/ksi-seed.grift.json` (singular, undated).
- Contents: the current catalog as a GRIFT batch with deterministic theme/indicator entity_ids (same UUIDv5 derivation as the collector uses; `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-pin-3`).
- Bundled with the plugin, committed to the plugin repo.
- Imported on fresh installs via `import_plugin_grift fedramp_20x_ksi`; subsequent imports skip per GRIFT's already-imported guard.

This preserves the offline / no-GitHub install path. Once the plugin is up, the collector takes over for updates. The seed gets refreshed in place (filename stays the same) when a maintainer decides to bump it — initially manually, eventually via a future emitter that rebakes from current grid state.

The previously-shipped `ksi-initial-YYYY-MM-DD.grift.json` and any `ksi-wave-YYYY-MM-DD.grift.json` files are deleted in this phase. `dimension.grift.json` survives untouched. The on-grid `Collector` node is **not** seeded via GRIFT — it is created by `reconcile_collector_nodes()` after plugin load (see `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-class-3` and the dual-existence pattern in `tap_grid/specs/spec-grid-dual-existence.md`).

#### Database state on existing dev installs

Per direction from spec review: the existing data in any developer's local TAP grid can be wiped and re-collected from a fresh KSI collector run, or re-seeded via `import_plugin_grift` followed by a collector run. No migration of historical wave provenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation-1 | Code Removed | Implemented | `skills/refresh-ksi-catalog/`, the upstream submodule, the nightly GitHub Action, and the plugin's `.gitmodules` have been deleted. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation-2 | Content Migrated | Implemented | Pinned source schema, UUID namespace, and denylist live byte-exact in `plugins/fedramp_20x_ksi/collectors/{pinned,safety}/`. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation-3 | Waves Replaced By Seed | Implemented | `ksi-initial-2026-04-23.grift.json` was removed; replaced by `ksi-seed.grift.json` with the same catalog content under a `tap.fedramp_20x_ksi.seed-v0` description format. `dimension.grift.json` survives. The on-grid `Collector` node is materialized via `reconcile_collector_nodes()` after plugin load, not seeded via GRIFT. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation-4 | v0 Spec Status Sync | Implemented | `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-refresh`, `-wave-schema`, and `-safety` are flipped to Deprecated in `spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-v0.md`; `-reference` reflects the single-seed model. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-deprecation-5 | Seed Singular And Undated | Implemented | The shipped seed file uses the fixed filename `ksi-seed.grift.json`; refreshes overwrite in place. | |

### Future Work
----
RID: `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-future`
Status: `Proposed`

Items intentionally deferred:

1. **Git collector base class.** The biggest deferred item, and the one we expect to land soonest. A `tap_cares.collectors.GitCollectorBase` would subclass `CollectorBase` and bake in the provenance posture that HTTPS-only fetch cannot provide. Concrete scope when it ships:

   - Pinned origin (URL + branch) check, replacing today's pinned-URL check.
   - Persistent shallow-clone cache lifecycle (`git clone --depth=1` first run; `git fetch` thereafter) in a tap_cares-owned cache dir (probably configurable via a `TAP_CARES_CACHE_DIR` setting).
   - `git merge-base --is-ancestor` rewind protection. Last-integrated SHA is read from the most recent successful `CollectionJob.description_json.data.source.commit_to` — the grid is the state store; no on-disk manifest needed.
   - Commit metadata extraction (`sha`, `date`, `author_name`, `author_email`, `signed`, `verified`, `message_first_line`).
   - A subclass hook so the KSI collector says *"my source document is `fedramp-consolidated-rules.json` in this checkout"* without the parent class needing to know about FedRAMP.

   Migration impact when this lands: the KSI collector resubclasses `GitCollectorBase` instead of `CollectorBase`; the dropped safety checks (`INTEGRITY_REWIND`, `ORIGIN_MISMATCH`, `COMMIT_AUTHOR_DRIFT`, signing checks) come back as block-class; `description_json.data.commits[]` returns; the HTTPS trust-model caveat in `req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-safety` becomes obsolete.

2. **Scheduled refresh.** Once `tap_cares` ships a scheduler (`req-tap-cares-v0-scheduler`), the KSI collector becomes the first concrete consumer. v0 KSI collector runs are triggered manually (Django shell, management command, or admin button).

3. **Emitter loop back to FedRAMP/rules.** When `tap_cares` emitters land, a complementary `KSIEmitter` could push local-instance edits back to the FedRAMP/rules repo as PRs, making a TAP installation the canonical authoring path. The collector's `description_json.data.source` already records the inverse direction; symmetry with an emitter is intentional.

4. **"Touch entity" primitive in tap_grid.** v0 KSI does change-only upsert — unchanged entities are left strictly alone. A future `touch_entity(entity_id)` service-layer primitive on tap_grid would let the collector bump `Entity.updated_at` on unchanged entities *without* generating a history row, enabling an "as of last run, still observed" semantic without the history-table noise that "upsert everything every run" would cause. Investigation belongs in `tap_grid` spec backlog, not here — the right home is the GRIFT / Entity spec, not a plugin spec.

5. **Delete semantics in GRIFT.** Current `tap_grid` GRIFT importer has no explicit delete operation; deprecation-via-modification fills the gap. A proper delete (with entity_id list + reasons) would let the catalog actually shrink rather than accumulate `deprecated` entries forever. Tracked in `tap_grid` spec backlog; the KSI collector adopts it if/when it ships.

6. **Live-fetch CI gate.** A nightly CI job that runs the `@pytest.mark.live_fetch` test against real upstream would catch upstream-shape changes early. Not a v0 must.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-future-1 | Named Successors | Proposed | The above six future items are named and cross-referenced to their owning specs / backlog items. | |
| req-fedramp-20x-ksi-collector-future-2 | Git Collector Base Scope Concrete | Proposed | The git-collector-base item names specific responsibilities (origin pin, clone cache, ancestor verification, commit metadata) so the future implementer has a clear scope. | |
